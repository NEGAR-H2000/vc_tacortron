# introducation

I’ m Negar Heydari, a bioelectrical medical engineer
I’m master student at Islamic Azad University of South Tehran branch.
I have completed my undergraduate course in medical engineering at Islamic Azad University, Qom branch.
In my undergraduate course, I have worked in fields such as artificial intelligence (CNN) and image processing due to experienced professors and also my personal interest.
Also, during the master's course, and more importantly, in the first semester,
when I was full of challenges at the beginning of this path, I met the dear professor Mr. Dr. Mahdi Eslami, 
through the course of digital signal processing, and with his help and guidance, I was able to successfully complete the project,
to advance the dsp lessons and also the path of starting the dissertation became smoother for me,
I had the honor of participating in the machine learning course of Mr. Dr. Eslami,
where I was able to gain experience and learn valuable tips in the presence of this great teacher.
